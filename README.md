# Empathy-One Support Model (by Mesina)

## Overview
Empathy-One is a lightweight, empathy-focused AI support model designed to enhance existing LLMs. It works by injecting empathetic, culturally sensitive responses into conversation flows based on real-time emotion detection, accent recognition, and cultural precision.

## Key Features
- Empathy Points: Inject empathetic responses into prompts at key conversational moments.
- Emotion Detection: Uses Hume's API to track live emotion KPIs and adjust responses.
- Accent Recognition: Detects regional accents and tailors responses with cultural precision.
- LLM Agnostic: Works as a layer on top of any LLM (Llama, OpenAI, etc.).

## How It Works
Empathy-One is designed to seamlessly integrate with existing LLMs by acting as a middleware that enhances the emotional intelligence of AI-driven conversations in any language. 

1. Emotion Detection: Real-time emotion analysis adjusts empathy levels during live interactions.
2. Cultural Precision: Recognizes accents and cultural context to provide nuanced, localized responses.
3. Empathy Prompting: Adds empathetic language to conversation flows using custom prompts.

### Phase I:  Empathy Integration
- Focus on language detection and advanced empathy response.
- Supports Spanish, French, and other non-English languages.
- Detects basic emotions
- Tracks empathy KPIs  

### Phase II: Advanced Emotion Detection (In Development)
- Real-time emotion tracking.
- Real-time empathy languages based on empathy triggers.
